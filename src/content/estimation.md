# Estimation Questions

## Market Size & Scale
### Estimate how many search queries Google processes per second globally. Consider different devices, regions, and usage patterns in your calculation.

#### How to Answer

To approach this estimation question, start by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components. Begin your answer by stating your assumptions and the key factors you'll consider in your calculation. A good way to start is:

"To estimate the number of Google search queries per second globally, let's consider the following factors: global internet users, percentage of users who use Google, average searches per user per day, and regional variations in search behavior."

Then, walk through your calculation step-by-step, explaining your reasoning for each estimate. Use round numbers to make calculations easier. Consider different devices (mobile vs. desktop), regions (developed vs. developing countries), and usage patterns (peak hours vs. off-peak hours).

Remember to sanity-check your final estimate against any known statistics or common sense. If your result seems off, explain why and adjust your assumptions accordingly.

#### Example Answer

"Let's estimate the number of Google search queries per second globally:

1. Global internet users: Approximately 5 billion

2. Google's market share: Around 90% globally

3. Active Google users: 5 billion * 90% = 4.5 billion

4. Average searches per user per day:
   - Assume 20 searches per day for active users
   - 4.5 billion * 20 = 90 billion searches per day

5. Adjusting for regional variations:
   - Developed countries (30% of users): 30 searches/day
   - Developing countries (70% of users): 15 searches/day
   - Weighted average: (30% * 30) + (70% * 15) = 19.5 searches/day
   - Adjusted total: 4.5 billion * 19.5 = 87.75 billion searches/day

6. Device split:
   - Mobile (60%): 52.65 billion searches/day
   - Desktop (40%): 35.1 billion searches/day

7. Searches per second:
   - 87.75 billion / 24 hours / 3600 seconds = 1,015,625 searches/second

8. Accounting for peak hours:
   - Assume peak hours have 50% more searches
   - Peak hours (8 hours): 1,523,437 searches/second
   - Off-peak hours (16 hours): 761,718 searches/second

9. Weighted average:
   (8 * 1,523,437 + 16 * 761,718) / 24 = 1,015,625 searches/second

Therefore, I estimate that Google processes approximately 1 million search queries per second globally, with variations between 750,000 to 1.5 million depending on the time of day."


### Estimate the number of dentists currently practicing in New York City. How would this number need to change to meet the city's needs over the next five years?
#### How to Answer

To answer this question effectively, start by breaking it down into two main parts: estimating the current number of dentists and projecting future needs. Begin with a structured approach to estimate the current number of dentists in New York City. You can use population data, dentist-to-population ratios, and available statistics from dental associations or government sources.

For the estimation, consider using a top-down approach:

1. Start with the total population of New York City.
2. Estimate the number of people typically served by one dentist.
3. Factor in variables like specialization, part-time practitioners, and geographic distribution.

For the future projection, consider:

1. Population growth trends
2. Changes in dental care needs (e.g., aging population)
3. Technological advancements in dentistry
4. Economic factors affecting access to dental care

Use a conversational tone and explain your reasoning clearly. For example, you might start with:

"To estimate the number of dentists in New York City, let's begin with the city's population and work our way down. According to recent data..."

#### Example Answer

"To estimate the number of dentists currently practicing in New York City, let's start with the city's population of approximately 8.5 million people. Based on the national average of about 61 dentists per 100,000 people, we might expect around 5,185 dentists in NYC. However, we need to adjust this figure for several factors specific to New York City.

First, NYC likely has a higher concentration of dentists due to its urban nature and role as a major healthcare hub. Let's assume a 20% increase over the national average, bringing our estimate to about 6,220 dentists. Additionally, considering that some dentists may work part-time or in academic settings, we should add another 10% to account for these factors. This brings our final estimate to approximately 6,840 practicing dentists in New York City.

Looking at the next five years, several factors will influence the needed number of dentists:

1. Population growth: NYC's population is projected to grow by about 1% annually, reaching roughly 8.93 million by 2029. This alone would require an additional 360 dentists to maintain the current ratio.

2. Aging population: As the baby boomer generation ages, there will likely be an increased demand for dental services, potentially requiring a 5% increase in dentists, or about 340 more.

3. Technological advancements: While some technologies might increase efficiency, allowing dentists to see more patients, others might require more specialized care. Let's assume these factors balance out.

4. Economic factors: Improved access to dental insurance and growing awareness of oral health might increase demand by another 3%, requiring about 205 more dentists.

Considering these factors, New York City would need approximately 7,745 practicing dentists in five years, an increase of about 905 from our current estimate. This represents a 13.2% increase over the five-year period, or an average of 181 new dentists per year.

To meet this need, the city should focus on retaining current dentists, attracting new graduates, and potentially incentivizing dentists to work in underserved areas within the city. Additionally, promoting dental education programs and offering loan forgiveness for dentists who commit to practicing in NYC could help meet this growing demand."


### Estimate the total addressable market for a new smart home security system in the United States.
#### How to Answer

To estimate the total addressable market (TAM) for a new smart home security system in the United States, start by outlining a structured approach. Begin your answer by briefly explaining what TAM is and why it's important. Then, describe the method you'll use to calculate it, which in this case would be a top-down approach.

Next, break down your calculation into clear steps:

1. Determine the total number of households in the U.S.
2. Estimate the percentage of households that could potentially adopt smart home security systems.
3. Calculate the potential market size in terms of households.
4. Estimate the average annual revenue per household for smart home security systems.
5. Multiply the market size by the average annual revenue to get the TAM.

As you go through each step, explain your reasoning and cite any relevant data or assumptions. Be prepared to justify your estimates with market trends, consumer behavior, or industry reports.

Here's how you might start your answer:

"To estimate the total addressable market for a new smart home security system in the U.S., I'll use a top-down approach. First, let's consider the total number of households in the country..."

#### Example Answer

"To estimate the total addressable market for a new smart home security system in the U.S., I'll use a top-down approach.

First, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 128 million households in the United States as of 2023.

Next, we need to estimate the percentage of households that could potentially adopt smart home security systems. Based on current market trends and increasing awareness of home security, I'd estimate that about 60% of households could be potential customers. This gives us a potential market size of 76.8 million households (128 million * 60%).

Now, let's estimate the average annual revenue per household for smart home security systems. A typical smart home security package might include equipment costs and monthly monitoring fees. Let's assume an average upfront cost of $300 for equipment and an average monthly fee of $30 for monitoring services.

Annual revenue per household = $300 + ($30 * 12 months) = $660

Finally, we can calculate the total addressable market:

TAM = 76.8 million households * $660 per household = $50.688 billion

Therefore, I estimate the total addressable market for a new smart home security system in the United States to be approximately $50.7 billion annually.

It's important to note that this is a high-level estimate and could be refined further with more detailed market research and segmentation. Factors such as urbanization rates, crime statistics, and consumer adoption of smart home technologies could all influence the actual market size."
