Next, introduce your chosen North Star metric, explaining why it's the most suitable indicator of success for this specific initiative. Be sure to highlight how this metric aligns with Spotify's overall business goals and reflects user value.

#### Example Answer

To measure the success of Spotify's major podcast initiative, I would propose the following metrics:

North Star Metric: Weekly Active Podcast Listeners (WAPL)

This metric directly reflects user engagement with the new podcast feature and aligns with Spotify's goal of becoming a leading platform for audio content. It's a clear indicator of how well the podcast initiative is resonating with users and driving regular engagement.

Supporting metrics:

1. Podcast Listening Time: This metric measures the total time users spend listening to podcasts weekly. It complements WAPL by providing insight into the depth of engagement, not just the breadth.

2. Podcast-to-Music Ratio: This tracks the proportion of time users spend on podcasts versus music. It helps us understand if podcasts are cannibalizing music listening or if they're additive to overall platform usage.

3. Podcast Discovery Rate: This measures the percentage of users who listen to a new podcast each week. It indicates how well our recommendation algorithms and discovery features are working.

4. Podcast Retention Rate: This tracks the percentage of users who return to listen to subsequent episodes of a podcast series. It helps us understand the quality and stickiness of the podcast content we're offering.

By focusing on Weekly Active Podcast Listeners as our North Star metric, we can gauge the overall success of the initiative in terms of user adoption. The supporting metrics provide deeper insights into user behavior, content quality, and the impact on Spotify's core music business. Together, these metrics offer a comprehensive view of the podcast initiative's performance and can guide future strategy and product decisions.
