# Product Design / Product Sense Questions

## Product Analysis
### Choose a product you use frequently and deeply admire. What makes it great, what are its current limitations, and how would you improve it? Please consider business viability and technical feasibility in your response.
#### How to Answer

To answer this question effectively, start by briefly introducing the product you've chosen and why you admire it. This sets the stage for your analysis. Then, structure your response into three main parts:

1. What makes it great: Discuss the product's key strengths and unique selling points. Consider aspects like user experience, functionality, design, and how it solves user problems.

2. Current limitations: Identify areas where the product falls short or could be improved. Be specific and explain why these limitations matter.

3. How you would improve it: Propose realistic enhancements that address the limitations you've identified. Consider both business viability and technical feasibility in your suggestions.

Throughout your answer, demonstrate your product thinking by explaining the reasoning behind your observations and ideas. Use concrete examples to illustrate your points.

For instance, you might begin with: "I'd like to discuss Spotify, a music streaming app I use daily and greatly admire. Its personalized playlists and vast library make it my go-to for music discovery, but there are some areas where I see potential for improvement..."

#### Example Answer

"I'd like to discuss Airbnb, a platform I use frequently for travel accommodations and deeply admire for its innovative approach to hospitality.

What makes it great:
Airbnb excels in several areas. First, its user interface is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to search and book accommodations. The platform offers a wide variety of unique stays, from treehouses to castles, providing experiences that traditional hotels can't match. Airbnb's review system builds trust between hosts and guests, creating a community-driven marketplace. Additionally, their smart pricing algorithm helps hosts optimize their rates based on demand, seasonality, and local events.

Current limitations:
Despite its strengths, Airbnb faces some challenges. Inconsistency in accommodation quality can be an issue, as there's no standardized rating system like traditional hotels. The platform also struggles with last-minute cancellations by hosts, which can significantly disrupt travel plans. Furthermore, in some cities, Airbnb faces regulatory hurdles due to concerns about its impact on local housing markets and neighborhoods.

How I would improve it:
To address these limitations, I propose the following improvements:

1. Implement a standardized quality assurance program: Introduce an Airbnb-certified rating system based on specific criteria like cleanliness, accuracy of listing description, and amenities. This would help guests make more informed decisions and incentivize hosts to maintain high standards.

2. Enhance cancellation protection: Develop a robust system to minimize the impact of last-minute host cancellations. This could include partnering with local hotels to provide guaranteed backup accommodations and implementing stricter penalties for hosts who frequently cancel.

3. Introduce a local community integration feature: To address concerns about Airbnb's impact on neighborhoods, create a feature that connects guests with local businesses and events. This could include discounts at nearby restaurants or tickets to local attractions, helping to distribute the economic benefits of tourism more broadly.

4. Develop an AI-powered personalized travel planner: Leverage Airbnb's data on user preferences and travel patterns to create an AI assistant that can suggest entire itineraries, including accommodations, activities, and restaurants. This would differentiate Airbnb from competitors and potentially open new revenue streams.

These improvements are technically feasible given Airbnb's existing infrastructure and data capabilities. From a business perspective, they would enhance user satisfaction, potentially increase bookings and average stay duration, and help address regulatory concerns, contributing to Airbnb's long-term sustainability and growth."


### Pick a product that has provided significant value to you in the past year. Walk me through its strengths and weaknesses, and propose three specific improvements that would increase user engagement.
#### How to Answer

To effectively answer this question, start by briefly introducing the product you've chosen and why it has been valuable to you. This sets the context for your analysis. Then, structure your response using the following framework:

1. Strengths: Highlight 2-3 key strengths of the product, focusing on features or aspects that have contributed to its value for you.

2. Weaknesses: Identify 2-3 areas where the product falls short or could be improved.

3. Improvements: Propose three specific enhancements that would address the weaknesses and increase user engagement. For each improvement, explain how it would benefit users and potentially impact key metrics.

Throughout your answer, use concrete examples and data points where possible to support your analysis. Be prepared to explain your reasoning for each point you make.

Here's a brief example of how you might start:

"I'd like to discuss Spotify, which has been incredibly valuable to me this past year. Its personalized playlists and vast music library have significantly enhanced my daily listening experience. However, there are areas where I believe it could be improved..."

#### Example Answer

"I'd like to discuss Notion, a productivity and collaboration tool that has significantly improved my workflow over the past year. Notion has become integral to my personal and professional organization, but it also has room for improvement.

Strengths:
1. Flexibility: Notion's block-based system allows for incredible customization. I can create anything from simple to-do lists to complex project management dashboards.
2. Collaboration features: The ability to share pages and workspaces has made team projects much more efficient.
3. Integration capabilities: Notion connects well with other tools I use, like Slack and Google Drive, creating a more seamless workflow.

Weaknesses:
1. Learning curve: The initial setup and understanding of Notion's full capabilities can be overwhelming for new users.
2. Mobile experience: The mobile app lacks some functionality and can be slow to load large databases.
3. Offline access: Limited offline capabilities can be frustrating when working without an internet connection.

Proposed Improvements:

1. Interactive onboarding experience:
Implement a guided, interactive tour for new users that showcases Notion's key features through practical examples. This could include pre-built templates that users can customize during the onboarding process. For instance, guide users through creating a personal dashboard with a to-do list, note-taking area, and goal tracker.

Impact: This would reduce the initial learning curve, leading to higher user activation rates and increased engagement in the crucial first weeks of use. We could measure this through metrics like "percentage of new users who create 3+ pages in their first week" or "time to first shared workspace."

2. Enhanced mobile optimization:
Redesign the mobile app to prioritize speed and core functionalities. This could involve creating a simplified view for large databases, implementing better caching for offline access, and optimizing the app's performance.

Impact: Improved mobile experience would likely increase daily active users on mobile and the average time spent in the app. We could track metrics like "mobile DAU/MAU ratio" and "average session duration on mobile" to measure success.

3. Expanded offline mode:
Develop a robust offline mode that allows users to access and edit their most frequently used pages and databases without an internet connection. Implement smart syncing to update changes once the connection is restored.

Impact: This feature would be particularly valuable for users who travel or work in areas with unreliable internet. We could measure its success through "number of offline edits made" and "user satisfaction scores for mobile app reliability."

These improvements address key pain points while building on Notion's strengths in flexibility and collaboration. By enhancing the onboarding process, mobile experience, and offline capabilities, we can expect to see increased user engagement across both new and existing users, ultimately driving long-term retention and product advocacy."


### Analyze a product that you think has poor user experience. How would you redesign it to improve usability while maintaining its core functionality?
#### How to Answer

To effectively answer this question, start by identifying a product with poor user experience that you're familiar with. Begin your response by briefly describing the product and its core functionality. Then, outline the specific usability issues you've observed.

A good way to structure your answer is:

1. Introduce the product and its purpose
2. Highlight 2-3 key usability problems
3. Propose redesign solutions for each problem
4. Explain how your solutions maintain core functionality while improving usability

Remember to use specific examples and demonstrate your understanding of user-centered design principles. You might say something like:

"I'd like to discuss the user experience of [Product X], which is designed to [core functionality]. While it serves its primary purpose, there are several usability issues that hinder its effectiveness..."

Keep your analysis focused and avoid generalizations. Use concrete examples of how the current design fails users and how your proposed changes would address these issues.

#### Example Answer

"I'd like to analyze the user experience of a popular budgeting app I've used called MoneyTracker. Its core functionality is to help users track expenses, set budgets, and achieve financial goals. However, I've identified several usability issues that I believe could be improved.

Firstly, the process of manually inputting expenses is cumbersome. Users need to navigate through multiple screens and dropdown menus to categorize each transaction. To address this, I would redesign the expense entry interface to use a single-screen approach with smart categorization. This could include implementing AI to suggest categories based on merchant names and allowing users to create custom shortcuts for frequent expenses.

Secondly, the app's visualization of spending patterns is confusing and lacks customization options. The current pie charts and bar graphs are cluttered and don't provide actionable insights. I would redesign this feature to include interactive, customizable dashboards. Users could choose which metrics to display and easily compare spending across different time periods or categories.

Lastly, the goal-setting feature is buried within the app and doesn't provide enough feedback on progress. To improve this, I would create a dedicated 'Goals' tab in the main navigation. This section would include visual progress bars, celebratory notifications for milestones, and suggestions for staying on track.

These redesigns would maintain MoneyTracker's core functionality of expense tracking and budgeting while significantly improving its usability. The streamlined expense entry would encourage more frequent and accurate logging. The improved visualizations would help users better understand their finances. And the enhanced goal-setting feature would increase engagement and motivation for users to achieve their financial objectives.

By focusing on these key areas, we can transform MoneyTracker from a functional but frustrating app into an intuitive and empowering financial tool."
