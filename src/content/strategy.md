# Strategy Questions

## Market Entry & Expansion
### Google is considering entering the ride-sharing market. Evaluate this opportunity considering their current assets, potential competitive advantages, and challenges. Would you recommend they enter? If yes, what would be your go-to-market strategy?
#### How to Answer

When answering this question, start by acknowledging the complexity of B2B software and the importance of effective onboarding. Then, outline a structured approach to improving the onboarding experience. Begin with something like:

"To improve the user onboarding experience for a complex B2B software product, I would focus on several key areas..."

From there, discuss strategies such as:

1. Understanding user needs and pain points
2. Creating personalized onboarding paths
3. Implementing interactive product tours
4. Providing contextual guidance
5. Offering multi-channel support

Be sure to emphasize the importance of user feedback and continuous improvement throughout the onboarding process. You can conclude with a statement about measuring success and iterating based on user data and feedback.

#### Example Answer

"To improve the user onboarding experience for a complex B2B software product, I would focus on several key areas:

First, I would conduct in-depth user research to understand the various user personas and their specific needs. For example, if we're dealing with an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, we might have finance users, HR professionals, and operations managers, each with different priorities and pain points.

Based on this research, I would create personalized onboarding paths. Let's say we found that finance users primarily need to set up reporting dashboards, while HR users focus on employee management features. We would design separate guided tours for each group, highlighting the most relevant features first.

Next, I would implement interactive product tours using a tool like Pendo or WalkMe. These tours would provide step-by-step guidance on key tasks, such as creating a new financial report or setting up an employee onboarding workflow. We would ensure these tours are contextual, appearing at the right moment when a user is likely to need that specific feature.

To address the complexity of the software, I would introduce a progressive disclosure approach. Instead of overwhelming users with all features at once, we would start with core functionalities and gradually introduce more advanced features as users become more comfortable with the system. For instance, in the first week, we might focus on basic data entry and navigation. In week two, we could introduce more complex reporting tools.

I would also establish a multi-channel support system. This would include in-app chat support for immediate assistance, a comprehensive knowledge base with video tutorials and FAQs, and scheduled check-in calls with customer success managers for more in-depth guidance.

To ensure continuous improvement, I would implement analytics to track user engagement and identify potential drop-off points in the onboarding process. We would use tools like Mixpanel or Amplitude to monitor key metrics such as time-to-first-value and feature adoption rates.

Lastly, I would create a feedback loop with users through regular surveys and user interviews. This would help us identify pain points and areas for improvement in the onboarding process.

By implementing these strategies, we would aim to reduce time-to-value, increase user adoption, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and retention. We would measure success through metrics like reduced support tickets, increased feature usage, and improved Net Promoter Scores. Based on these metrics and ongoing user feedback, we would continuously iterate and refine our onboarding process to better serve our users' needs."



### Amazon has been contemplating developing its own smartphone. Analyze the strategic implications, potential differentiation, and risks. Would you recommend this move? Why or why not?

#### How to Answer

To answer this question effectively, start by acknowledging Amazon's position in the tech industry and its history with smartphone development. Then, structure your response around three key areas: strategic implications, potential differentiation, and risks.

Begin with a statement like: "To evaluate whether Amazon should develop its own smartphone, we need to consider the strategic implications, potential for differentiation, and associated risks."

For strategic implications, discuss how a smartphone could fit into Amazon's ecosystem and business model. Consider factors like:
- Expanding Amazon's reach in the mobile market
- Integrating with existing Amazon services
- Potential for data collection and customer insights

When addressing potential differentiation, focus on unique features or capabilities Amazon could offer, such as:
- Deep integration with Amazon's e-commerce platform
- Alexa-powered features and functionality
- Exclusive content or services for Amazon Prime members

For risks, consider challenges like:
- Intense competition in the smartphone market
- High development and marketing costs
- Potential for failure (referencing past attempts like the Fire Phone)

Conclude with a clear recommendation based on your analysis, explaining why you believe it would or wouldn't be a good move for Amazon.

Remember to use specific examples and data points to support your arguments throughout your answer.

#### Example Answer

To evaluate whether Amazon should develop its own smartphone, we need to consider the strategic implications, potential for differentiation, and associated risks.

Strategic implications of entering the smartphone market are significant for Amazon. Firstly, it would allow Amazon to have a direct presence in consumers' pockets, potentially increasing engagement with Amazon's services. A smartphone could seamlessly integrate with Amazon's e-commerce platform, Prime Video, Kindle, and Alexa, creating a more cohesive ecosystem. This integration could lead to increased customer loyalty and higher spending within the Amazon ecosystem. Additionally, having its own smartphone would give Amazon valuable first-party data on user behavior, which could be used to improve its services and targeted advertising.

In terms of differentiation, Amazon has several unique selling points it could leverage. The company could create a deeply integrated shopping experience, making it incredibly easy for users to purchase products directly from their phones. For example, they could implement features like image recognition for instant product searches or one-click purchasing tied to users' Prime accounts. Amazon could also differentiate through Alexa integration, offering advanced voice-controlled features that go beyond what's currently available on other smartphones. Exclusive content or services for Prime members could be another differentiator, such as ad-free mobile games or premium video content.

However, the risks associated with this venture are substantial. The smartphone market is highly competitive and dominated by established players like Apple and Samsung. Amazon's previous attempt with the Fire Phone in 2014 was a notable failure, resulting in a $170 million write-down. Developing a competitive smartphone requires significant investment in hardware, software, and marketing. There's also the risk of damaging relationships with current hardware partners who sell through Amazon's platform.

Given these factors, I would not recommend that Amazon develop its own smartphone at this time. The potential benefits don't outweigh the substantial risks and required investment. Instead, I would suggest that Amazon focus on deepening its integration with existing smartphone platforms through apps and services. This approach allows Amazon to achieve many of the strategic benefits of having its own smartphone (increased engagement, data collection) without the associated risks and costs of hardware development.

For example, Amazon could develop a more comprehensive "Amazon Mobile" app that integrates shopping, Prime Video, Kindle, and Alexa functionalities. They could also partner with Android manufacturers to pre-install Amazon apps and offer special deals for Prime members. This strategy leverages Amazon's strengths in software and services while avoiding the pitfalls of hardware development and fierce market competition.

For example, you might say, "This approach allows Netflix to establish a presence in the market now while positioning itself for growth as internet penetration increases."

#### Example Answer

Expanding Netflix's market share in a country with low internet penetration would require a comprehensive strategy that addresses both technological and cultural challenges. Here's how I would approach it:

First, we would need to adapt our technology to the local infrastructure. This might involve developing more efficient video compression algorithms to deliver high-quality content over slower internet connections. We could also invest in local content delivery networks (CDNs) to improve streaming quality and reliability.

Secondly, I would propose partnering with local telecom providers and internet service providers (ISPs). We could offer bundled packages where Netflix is included with mobile data plans or home internet services. This not only increases our reach but also incentivizes ISPs to improve their infrastructure.

Investing in local content would be crucial. We would need to produce or acquire content that resonates with the local audience, including original series and movies in the local language. This strategy has proven successful for Netflix in markets like India, where they invested over $400 million in local content between 2019 and 2021.

To address limited internet access, we could implement alternative distribution methods. For instance, we could develop a feature that allows users to download content when they have access to Wi-Fi and watch it offline later. In some areas, we might even consider physical distribution points where users can download content to their devices.

Educating the market about streaming services and digital literacy would be essential. We could launch initiatives similar to Rwanda's Digital Ambassadors program, where we train local youth to educate others about internet use and the benefits of streaming services.

Lastly, we would need to adapt our pricing strategy to the local economic conditions. This might involve introducing mobile-only plans at lower price points, as Netflix did in India, or partnering with local payment providers to offer more accessible payment options.

By implementing these strategies, we can establish Netflix's presence in the market now while positioning ourselves for significant growth as internet penetration increases over time. This approach allows us to build brand awareness, gain valuable market insights, and cultivate a loyal customer base that will expand along with the country's digital infrastructure.
